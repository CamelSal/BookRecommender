# Book Recommender

This repository contains the code and documentation for a book recommender system


## Overview

In today's world, with an ever-increasing number of books being published, it can be challenging for readers to discover books that align with their interests. The problem area this project addresses is the need for an intelligent book recommendation system that connects readers with books they are likely to enjoy. As an avid reader, I have personally encountered this problem. There are countless books available, and categories can be too vague. Therefore, I aim to create a system that makes finding enjoyable books easier.

As A reliable book recommender can significantly increase users' reading rate by reducing the time spent searching for new books to read and by ensuring they find more engaging or enjoyable books. 

This project aims to leverage machine learning to create a book recommender system. The system will provide accurate recommendations using various approaches, including content-based, collaborative filtering, or hybrid methods. Algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) and Funk Singular Value Decomposition will be explored to identify similar users or predict user ratings for book recommendations.

## Dataset

For this project will be working with the data [GoodBooks-10K](https://github.com/zygmuntz/goodbooks-10k) whichcontains four indidual files that will be utilized to build the book recommender system.

#### **books.csv**: A dataset with 10,000 unique books from Goodreads.

#### **ratings.csv**: Contains 6.1 million user ratings for the books.


#### **tags.csv**: Includes various user-generated tags that can be associated with books.

#### **book_tags.csv**: Provides information on how often users have applied specific tags to books.
